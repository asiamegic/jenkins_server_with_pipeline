Main function of the script, the app receives and requests and displays their number</b><br>
<b>*</b> files are in the DEV branch<br>

There is a JS application project as well as a dockerbuild file for building the image.

JS application is launched as a server using the command<br><br>
<b>npm run start</b> <br>
or<br>
<b>node server.js/</b><br>
by default on port 3000. if you want to run on port 80 you need additional privileges on the server

you can test the application by typing in the browser<br><br>
<b>http://ip_address:your_port</b><br><br>
or curl commands <br>
<br>
<b>curl -X POST localhost:3000 <br>
curl -X GET localhost:3000 </b>
